Coding Bugfixes
- Wallslide should end on landing
- Walking into a wall while still grounded should not change one's direction.
- Extend character triggers & check if only inside one (onGround only if not on wall also)
- Horizontal movement lingering after wall slide
- Character select icons visible when multiple hover (put each corner on a layer)
X Limit knockback / total velocity to a certain value
X Audio from menu should carry over to character select
X [Fixed by capsule collider] Velocity lingering when not landing on a valid floor (like a player's head)
X Character floats when moving up a slope (no longer technically on ground) (use a capsule collider)
X Menu changes shape with screen sizes
X Hud too high off bottom of screen
