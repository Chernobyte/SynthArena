Coding Bugfixes
- Character floats when moving up a slope (no longer technically on ground) (use a capsule collider)
- Extend character triggers & check if only inside one (onGround only if not on wall also)
- Horizontal movement lingering after wall slide
- Limit knockback / total velocity to a certain value
- Character select icons visible when multiple hover (put each corner on a layer)
- Velocity lingering when not landing on a valid floor (like a player's head)
- Menu changes shape with screen sizes
X Hud too high off bottom of screen
